This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Vera Ballance, I'm 24 years old and have been living in New York City for a little over 2 years. I graduated from Florida State University in May 2022 with my degree in Information, Communication and Technology. A few coding languages I learned while studying are C++, JavaScript, html and css. After graduating, I took a job at a Midtown based Private Equity firm as a Receptionist/IT Assistant. I later went on to work as an Executive Assistant at an Architecture Firm as I was unsure of exactly how I wanted to get in the IT field and wanted to try something new. I currently work at Prada USA Corp as the Office Assistant with plans to progress in the company into an area that is best fit for my skills.
